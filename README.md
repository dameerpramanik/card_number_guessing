# card_number_guessing
A SIMPLE PROJECT I IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON BASED ON A NUMBER GUESSING TRICK USING 5 CARDS WITH NUMBERS ON THEM.

ABOUT:
1. Think of a number between 1 and 30.
2. You will be presented with 5 cards respectfully, answering yes or no to whether your number is on that card.
3. at the end the person or in this case the computer will correctly guess your number.

Based on the computations in the code, try to figure out how it works.

Feel free to modify and reuse.
